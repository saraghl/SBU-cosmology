in this project, we will analyze the numerical data of supernovas provided by the Berkeley University Laboratory, which has been compiled in the SCP (Supernova Cosmology Project) group. The data includes four columns: supernova name, redshift, distance modulus, and error related to the distance modulus measurement. We will answer the given questions in the pdf file named "CHW2" and utilize the Metropolis algorithm to obtain the distribution of the free parameters Œ©ùëö and Œ©Œõ. In order to implement the MCMC algorithm and become familiar with Bayesian interference you can check out the file "Bayesian and MCMC". please send your homework to the mail sbucosmology401@gmail.com before the deadline.
